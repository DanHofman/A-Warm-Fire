      <br>
      <div  class="part">
        <p>David had walked for miles across the California desert. He could feel the sand and the dust inside his hip joints, and he was long past feeling the sharp ache in the arches of the two rocks he had once called feet, but he had to keep walking. </p>

        <p>There was a destination. To the west there was at least the possibility of escape. The voice said there were aircraft with enough fuel to carry his companions and him across the Pacific. The far east was untouched, and it offered a refuge for the people still wandering. Come to the City of Angels, that’s what the broadcast said. </p>

        <p>The message came through the radio the first time, filling David with a shadow of hope, but this hope turned to resentment, because the broadcast had to be some sort of trick. David didn’t think there could be an airplane. He had heard the message though, and couldn’t forget something like that. A plane meant putting distance between them and everything else, and he wasn’t ready to give up just yet.</p>

        <p>Five cars with six men and five women had left from Colorado, with enough gasoline to make it to Las Vegas. There was a kid too, but David pushed that picture from his mind. Now there were four of them, no cars, a little food and water, with only the clothes they wore.</p>

        <p>David tripped and fell onto the pavement. The ground seemed comfortable to him even as the tar started to sear his cheek. </p>

        <p>“David, get up,” Jeremy said. “Come on, the sun’s not down yet, just an hour or so,” The yellow bandana over his hair stood out when he kneeled down.</p>

        <p>“Leave it alone Jeremy, let’s just camp here for the night.” Tara paused, “I’m tired,” she added.</p>

        <p>David felt water on his head and shifted to look at his assailant. She was kneeling with Jeremy and they were both staring at him with something on par with pity. </p>

        <p>“You all right?” She and Jeremy lifted David to his feet and walked him over to a large grey rock. </p>

        <p>David shook his head and took a swig of water from his bottle. </p>

        <p>“Sorry, just sorta blacked out there.” </p>

        <p>Jeremy stood over him, blocking orange rays from the setting sun; his hands were on his hips. </p>

        <p>“That’s all right bud. We all have our days.” </p>

        <p>David chuckled but then coughed. Now there was something that didn’t need to be said, he thought. </p>

        <p>Jeremy chuckled with him. </p>

        <p>“Where’d Tara go?” </p>

        <p>“She went ahead to get Arnold, we’re gonna settle in for the night,” he said. “Looks like you were the first to quit.” </p>

        <p>“Fuck off.”</p>

        <p>“You know I’m just playing around. My vagina’s just not as substantial as yours.” </p>

        <p>David let that hang in the air. </p>

        <p>Jeremy sighed, “okay, I’m gonna go get the fire started. You sit as long as you want.” </p>

        <p>“Hold on asshole,” David forced himself up.</p>

        <p>Together they set up a camp, David collecting tinder from the dead thickets that poked through the sand, while Jeremy grabbed as much dry wood from the surrounding dunes as he could find. Together they rolled the bigger rocks over to serve as benches, and on one side of where they would make a fire pit, they laid down a tarp to help make a sleeping area on top of the hot sand. They chose a spot with some trees so they could have protection from the sun when they woke up; but of course, they would need to get up early to avoid walking in the heat of the day anyway. </p>

        <p>By the time the fire was going the sun had set, and the warmth of the day was replaced with a dry chill. Tara had come back with Arnold and together they huddled around the fire.</p>

        <p>Arnold held onto the remaining stores of food, but you would never know it looking at that wiry frame of his. A man who insisted on managing their meals but barely ate himself. He cooked canned beans with bacon in a large pot big enough that everyone would eat. Arnold’s eyes never left the food. </p>

        <p>“You have to keep stirring, or the bottom will burn, and we will waste another can like we did in Nevada. God knows we can’t afford to lose any more food,” he said. “See those little bubbles? Those are the good bubbles. The big ugly bubbles are the ones that you got to look for.”</p>

        <p>“Okay Emeril,” Tara said and Jeremy laughed from his belly. </p>

        <p>David spit. </p>

        <p>“You’re welcome. I’m glad to do the work,” Arnold’s eyes flicked around the fire. </p>

        <p>David knew what Arnold was getting at.</p>

        <p>***</p>

        <p>Las Vegas had been bad. There were eight of them back then, and David still had his sister, Sara. </p>

        <p>Upon reaching the city the group had decided to split up to look for supplies-which was acceptable because back then they still had GPS-and besides, the city was deserted. They would meet at nightfall and leave the city. </p>

        <p>Sara’s group never showed up at the meeting place. </p>

        <p>David and Jeremy used the GPS to track them down, but only found her empty Nissan, and the car showed no signs of distress. </p>

        <p>Then something came through the walkie talkie. </p>

        <p>“Cold,” Sara’s voice crackled through in a voice that was little more than a mechanical whisper. </p>

        <p>David refused to leave, and went after her in the stranded car, bringing the radio and a trunk full of firearms he claimed as his. He searched the city screaming her name in every abandoned hotel, knowing he wouldn’t find her. She would do the same for him, he thought. </p>

        <p>Before leaving, David dragged the few barrels of remaining gasoline into the Luxor and set the place on fire, and as drunk on Jim Beam as he was, he was lucky he didn’t join the hotel in a pile of ashes. On the highway out of town he flipped the car though, and when he woke from the crash, he was alone on the road except for the car he had destroyed. To his surprise, when he radioed they did come back for him. He wasn’t sure who made what decision, but he always thought that Arnold was probably the one who wanted to leave him behind. </p>

        <p>David wouldn’t have blamed him. </p>

        <p>***</p>

        <p>David stood up and stepped away from the fire, his appetite gone. He walked until the fire was small and the moon was bright. Staring into the mountains, he thought of his sister.</p>

        <p>“You mind if I join you?” </p>

        <p>David mumbled a response. </p>

        <p>Tara was more than fair to him. She had been the one who had cleaned him up after the car accident; while Jeremy and Arnold had practically ignored his existence for a couple of days. </p>

        <p>“Aren’t you cold?” She asked. To this David gave her a sarcastic eyeball. </p>

        <p>“I’m serious.”</p>

        <p>The wind was getting more aggressive, but compared to Denver it was the Sahara.</p>

        <p>“You’d think that he could leave it alone. I mean, we all know what happened to Arnold, yet he’s still gonna-” David stopped speaking and shook his head. Tara moved closer to him; her footsteps made no sound. </p>

        <p>“We need you here, David,” she touched his arm and he turned his eyes to her. The fingers on his arm were warm and David couldn’t help but look her over a little. She spoke quietly now, “we don’t have time do this over and over and over.” Her short red hair fell to her face, her eyes were two dark stars hiding beneath. She pulled his face towards hers. Her lips were dry but he enjoyed the surprise; she was the one to pull away. </p>

        <p>“I’m still here,” she turned around and walked back to the camp. </p>

        <p>David woke up the next morning with sand in his mouth. He spit hard but there always seemed to be more rocks in his mouth. He stood up–the crackling of the tarp was loud in the quiet desert–and stretched his arms. Everyone else was asleep, and the sun was just spreading its light. </p>

        <p>“How long you been up?” Jeremy said with his head still buried in his arm.</p>

        <p>“I just woke up.”</p>

        <p>“We better get going while it’s still cool. Tara?”</p>

        <p>“I’m up,” she said. “just be quiet.” </p>

        <p>“Arnold?”</p>

        <p>David looked at Arnold. </p>

        <p>“Arnold!” Jeremy said in a muffled yell. </p>

        <p>Still no response. Tara stood up and rubbed her hair with one hand, walked over to Arnold, and kicked him. Arnold shuddered, and rolled over to view his attacker, but said nothing. </p>

        <p>David took care of the tarp; Arnold collected all the other supplies, and shortly after, they started marching along the road. David thought it was cooler today, but after an hour or so, he could tell it was going to be more of the same.</p>

        <p>Fucking dessert, he thought, but he knew it was still better than the cold. </p>

        <p>“You see that?” Jeremy said after they had been walking through the morning into the afternoon.</p>

        <p>David squinted into the waves of heat and could see red’s and blues against the yellow. </p>

        <p>“Rest stop?”</p>

        <p>Arnold just grumbled.</p>

        <p>When they came closer to what they thought might be a rest stop, they found what could almost be called a town. A big diner with windows which covered the entire side of the building, a couple gas stations and some modest empty houses formed the community. They took refuge in the “Valley Diner,” hoping to find some canned food they could salvage or maybe a working stove. </p>

        <p>Arnold was all smiles once he saw the kitchen. </p>

        <p>“This stove’ll work Jay” he said. “‘S got its own gas supply.”</p>

        <p>Jeremy smiled, and gave Arnold a short nod.</p>

        <p>Arnold cooked lunch right on the stove and when they were done eating, they drank bottled water from the sleeping refrigerator. </p>

        <p>“Careful David, don’t wanna let these two catch you smiling,” Tara said. David responded with a deliberate frown.</p>

        <p>They rested inside the building until the sun passed its most threatening phase, and while they waited Jeremy investigated the surrounding part of town to see if there was anything useful. </p>

        <p>“Shut up, you hear that?” David said this and the diner went quiet. The rumblings of an engine could be heard coming from outside, and the three of them slunk down in the diner booths. David peered out the large window that ran along the entire front of the diner, and waited as the rumbling got louder.</p>

        <p>“What is it?” Tara said and David shushed her. </p>

        <p>An old recreational vehicle pulled up to the diner and stopped. It was large and tan with a big brown stripe along its side; the top protruded as a white hump. The vehicle sat for a few minutes, the idling sound of the big truck stewing the growing anxiety in the three of them. David turned his head and looked through the diner for an exit, spotting the kitchen door leading to what he hoped would be an back door. </p>

        <p>David’s heart returned to its normal location in his chest when the passenger window rolled down to reveal the face of his friend, leaning over to the window. </p>

        <p>“Look what I got,” he said. </p>

        <p>David and Arnold filled up a couple red, plastic containers with gasoline from the shell station. Inside the station David ran into a slumped over body on top of a generator; the man had a note in his hand. His head was caved in on one side and a large revolver lay on the ground. David picked up the note as Arnold entered the mart ringing some chimes attached to the door.</p>

        <p><i>Jesus will find me </i>the note read.</p>

        <p>Arnold said nothing about the dead man, and instead took the initiative to pull him off the generator; and together David and he carried the generator into the truck. While he was moving the heavy machine, David realized that the dead man’s presence meant this area hadn’t been touched yet. </p>

        <p>“Arnold, you think about what that guy in there means?”</p>

        <p>“‘Course,” he said.</p>

        <p>“Should we tell them?” </p>

        <p>“Jeremy won’t care,” Arnold said with a snort and a laugh.</p>

        <p>“Yeah, probably not.” </p>

      <div class="part">
        <p>With the new gear and transportation the four refugees were in high spirits, smiling their way across the desert. David was concerned though, because while they were getting closer to Los Angeles, the broadcast they had been holding on to had disappeared. </p>

        <p>“Will you stop fucking with the radio, I’m sick of listening to static,” Jeremy said. “Seriously man.”</p>

        <p>“We haven’t seen anything since Nevada, we’re fine.” </p>

        <p>David continued to tune the radio.</p>

        <p>“The first time we heard it, had it been on FM or AM? Try switching between the two,” Arnold said.</p>

        <p>“I can’t remember,” David said. “I thought it was some universal channel or something.”</p>

        <p>“No. No such thing,” Arnold rushed up to the front seat and nudged David aside. </p>

        <p>“Don’t touch me, Arnie.” </p>

        <p>“David, Arnie, come on.” Tara said. </p>

        <p>So David stopped. He was afraid of saying something stupid. </p>

        <p>“I’m sick of the meatheads running the show up here,” Arnold started, “If you want to leave our survival up to these two-” he left the front console and walked to the back of the RV, laying down on the small bed. </p>

        <p>Jeremy sighed. </p>

        <p>David took this short opportunity to keep checking the radio but Jeremy pushed his hand away and turned it off. </p>

        <p>“I said give it a rest.” </p>

        <p>David left it alone. </p>

        <p>The more west they drove, the more yellow turned to green; round cacti sprung up along the road and new hills stretched across the horizon. But as they came closer to Los Angeles, the sky turned on them with a storm, black clouds spanned out in all directions with heavy droplets of rain pelting the car and the wind and clouds blinding and slowing them. </p>

        <p>“Can you turn the heater on?” Tara’s said.</p>

        <p>A road sign appeared suddenly out of the mist and displayed their progress; its green center and white outline stood out against the fog for only a moment. </p>

        <p>“Seventy miles guys,” Jeremy said. </p>

        <p>Only David was awake when the rain turned to hail. The loud impacts surrounded the vehicle, creating an effect of aural chaos for those inside. Jeremy was a good driver though, David thought. He just hoped that the ground didn’t become too slippery. </p>

        <p>“Well this sucks,” Jeremy said after a few tense minutes. </p>

        <p>David affirmed this with a grunt. </p>

        <p>The pounding ice woke Tara and Arnold in the back.</p>

        <p>We should be there by now, David thought. Where is the city? The wind howled and pushed against the car, blowing them into the shoulder. Tara screamed as the car careened off the road, and Arnold, who was walking along the corridor, was thrown against the side paneling with a hard thud. Tara shut her eyes and was clutched her armrest, while David stared out the wind shield wiping the fog away with one hand, squinting. </p>

        <p>As they mounted another hill, the clouds parted, revealing the city to them.</p>

        <p>David’s breath caught in his throat. He knew this was what they would find here. He knew that the broadcast had meant everything; and he knew it was stupid to ignore the signs. The storm. He had never seen a storm like that. Hail in southern California? But now he could only stare, transfixed by the scene in front of him. He wished he had been wrong. He would have loved to be proven wrong. </p>

        <p>The city of Los Angeles was a frozen tower of ice a thousand feet high. An army of cars were toys frozen inside the blanket of blue; the tops of the tallest skyscrapers breached the surface like so many steel arms. A whirlwind of black cloud circled the peak of the city, and beneath, savage bolts of lighting crashed down, each strike turning the air bright blue. </p>

        <p>The alien ship hovered above the pinnacle of the icy mountain. It twirled and spun in a malevolent dance. It gleaned and shone against the reflection of blue on blue, and David could see just how much at home the invaders were in this frigid new world. The bringers of ice. David immediately thought of Denver and sea of hard blue there. </p>

        <p>Invaders, and to think they offered peace. We blew that deal though didn’t we? Locking up the first of their visitors. It makes sense that their retaliation would be a total hostile takeover. </p>

        <p>So cold though. So alien. Who likes the cold except the villain? New York, Berlin, Tel Aviv, Mexico City, all frozen within weeks. Nothing to fight the cold. </p>

        <p>There are no planes.</p>

        <p>“Jeremy! Turn around!” He said. </p>

        <p>Jeremy woke up from his stupor and grabbed the wheel and spun the old RV 180 degrees. The big truck threatened to topple over as it lurched from side to side; the passengers screamed, but the car stayed upright. </p>

        <p>Arnold ran to the back of the car and gathered up their weapons. Two shotguns, three 38’s, the new magnum revolver, and a few boxes of shells. They also had a grenade which nobody really knew how to use. Arnold put the guns in a row on the floor in front of him and loaded each one, the shotguns first, then the pistols. </p>

        <p>David hoped the Ice men hadn’t seen them because Jeremy and David had been chased before. The Icicles would fly their craft out onto the road and send out a radiating pulse that would freeze anything liquid around. That was David’s theory. </p>

        <p>The icicles were not invincible though. David had shot one with a full blast of his double barrel in Denver and the Ice man had splintered into smaller shards of ice.</p>

        <p>Tara was looking out the back window, waiting for a trailing ship; and David watched her frantic breath painting little fog shapes on the window she leaned against. </p>

        <p>“David, I don’t see anything,” she yelled to the front of the cab. “But it’s really hard to see, it’s still so foggy.” </p>

        <p>“Where are we going Dave? I’m just drivin’ here.” Jeremy said.</p>

        <p>“Just keep going, we have to get out of this rain.”</p>

        <p>“It’s not gonna stop if they follow us,” Arnold said, and placed a map on the console between the two front seats. “We gotta go North. If we take this road back to the 395, we can hook up with the 59, which will take us to the five.” </p>

        <p>“What the fuck did you just say?” Jeremy said.</p>

        <p>“Its not that complicated,” he said. “We can take the five north while we figure out what-what we’re gonna do.”</p>

        <p>Jeremy drove blindly across the highways in the direction Arnold had instructed, all of the passengers were terrified this would be the time the invaders would catch up with them; the time that their car would fail. They were afraid that this would be the time they would get to learn what happened to the people who were captured. After an hour or so, they were traveling north, and the sky was a dark but cloudless void. The dry desert felt safe.</p>

        <p>Late into the night, they reached a new town. Jeremy parked the car in a covered area inside the loading dock of a department store. They all decided to sleep, though it would be a restless sleep. Arnold slept on the floor, insisting he enjoyed it, and David slept on the couch with Tara. She nuzzled into him and was quickly asleep too. David watched as Jeremy paced the car, somehow still awake and energized. David thought about getting up to take watch himself, but before he could stand, sleep took him, and he dreamt of his home. </p>

        <p>-</p>

        <p>Denver, David thought. Oh god, are they still-Why did I come back here? </p>

        <p>His apartment was like it was the last time he’d been there. Clothes and ravaged furniture were strewn everywhere, he had grabbed some things earlier, but now he had come back for some reason he couldn’t presently remember. He tripped on a small wooden stool that lay overturned and he fell a ridiculous distance to the large window which faced the street. He stayed on the floor, not feeling it, only feeling the pulsing cold; but he had landed close enough to the window so that he was now looking straight into the sky. The diamond ships with their black silver panes of ice glided through the blue overhead, each ship caught bursts of sunlight before it crossed over the apartment building and David found himself squinting; farther above the gliding ships was the even greater craft. The spinning monolith floated high into the sky, casting freezing winds, dark blue icy slush and its massive shadow across the city. </p>

        <p>He hated that he had come back here, when he had left the first time the monolith hadn’t settled yet. </p>

        <p>David propped himself up with considerable effort and peered downward into the streets. He saw the march of the ice men with their twisted metal machines. The metal beasts were going building to building, ripping away whole building walls and spraying their cold death into the exposed cavities. The sound of screams was always muted suddenly with the spray of the blue mist, and then the beasts would collect the frozen victims like piles of sticks. </p>

        <p>“David what is going on?” A voice said behind him. </p>

        <p>David whipped around.</p>

        <p>“Dad! We gotta get out of here, they’re going door to door. Where’s mom.” David grabbed his father’s arms. </p>

        <p>David’s father looked at his son, his eyes gleaming with the threat of tears. David didn’t have to ask what happened to his mother, so he pulled his dad and ran for the exit. His father resisted. </p>

        <p>“Dad, we gotta go,” David pulled his arm again. </p>

        <p>“I’m sorry David but I have to help the others, your mom wanted that.” </p>

        <p>“There are no others, please, we have to go now. They are flooding the city, we can either leave or die, come on.”</p>

        <p>David’s father laughed like a drunk viking. </p>

        <p>“David, I’ll be fine, you go, I’ll meet you in Las Vegas like we talked about.” </p>

        <p>David felt panic swarm him.</p>

        <p>“Please dad, come with me. Please. Why can’t you? Please come with me. Dad? Don’t stay here.”</p>

        <p>“It’s okay son,” he said softly.</p>

        <p>Just then the face of the apartment building tore away with a storm of wrenching metal and concrete and behind the open face was the one of the giant metal beast staring at David and his father in the now exposed apartment. David ran towards his father but his legs were moving so slow, and his feet were slipping on the floor while his father stayed the same distance from him even though he felt himself running. His father looked at the towering machine and showed no fear of the alien abomination, but he did turn to David and smile one last time before the machine unleashed its freezing breath. David watched his father’s face freeze in time with that last smile while the rest of the man’s body became layered with smooth ice. David screamed but his lungs were freezing too, his eyes burned. </p>

        <p>---</p>

        <p>He woke up breathing hard on the little bed in the back of the camper. Tara was propped up on her elbow rubbing his cheek with her free hand. He closed then opened his eyes and sighed, blinking his dream away. </p>

        <p>“You all right? She said.</p>

        <p>“Ya,” he closed his eyes again and remembered where he was, remembered that his dream was not real. He never saw his father die, or his mother; they had stayed in Denver just before the main invasion hit, sending David and his sister out. His mind liked to make him watch their deaths but he knew that he had not been there when it happened. They could still be alive for all he knew. </p>

        <p>“I can’t sleep either,” Tara said. </p>

        <p>David popped out of bed, knowing that even though he was tired, he didn’t want to sleep. </p>

        <p>“I’m gonna check the radio again.” </p>

        <p>Tara tiptoed behind him to the front of the cab. </p>

        <p>“David, I don’t think we are going to find it again. I’m not sure-” she started. “I don’t know, I want it just as bad as you do, but It seems too good to be true, and in my experience, that means that’s exactly what it is.” </p>

        <p>He swallowed the expletive which was his first response and then said, “What’s the harm in it?” David put the keys into the ignition and turned on the power. Static flooded the cabin and he turned down the volume, looking back to see if anyone had been disturbed. </p>

        <p>“It’s in the garage...” Arnold mumbled and turned over in his sleep, snoring. </p>

        <p>David and Tara looked at each other and giggled. </p>

        <p>Her laugh was a breeze. </p>

        <p>For a moment, David forgot about Los Angeles, about Denver, and about Las Vegas. He forgot the ice which had descended on his life. He forgot his mom and dad, and Sara. He forgot the nightmares, and forgot the incredible cold. He forgot endless escape, he forgot running. He saw her two eyes glowing in front of him and in that moment he only had a mind for her. </p>

        <p>“Well, go on then,” she said.</p>

        <p>He hadn’t spent a good minute with her for weeks, but he reached down to her this time, letting their faces meet and feeling her course through him like venom. He held her for a while, closing his eyes and remembering their time before the cold front.</p>

        <p>There were interrupted by the door to the trailer swinging open and a large figure barreling towards them up the stairs. </p>

        <p>“Why the fuck did you turn on the car!?” Jeremy yelled like an angry bear. </p>

        <p>Then came a low hum and Jeremy’s eyes grew wide. The were familiar with that sound. </p>

        <p>“Turn off the car!” Jeremy said, and Tara jumped on the front console turning the key to off. </p>

        <p>“I’m sorry Jay, I wanted to see-” </p>

        <p>“Be quiet. Maybe they won’t see us,” Jeremy said. </p>

        <p>Jeremy was a bad actor. He was practically sweating frustration. </p>

        <p>“That’s unlikely. If they followed us all the way here, they know where we are.” Arnold was suddenly in the front. </p>

        <p>David looked at Arnold, narrowing his eyes. </p>

        <p>“They could have sent several ships out, this might be the only one here,” he said. </p>

        <p>“Right.” </p>

        <p>Jeremy pushed Arnold against the wall, rattling the interior.</p>

        <p>“Then we’re all dead I guess,” he said. </p>

        <p>“Why you yelling at me? I’m not the one who turned on the car.” </p>

        <p>Jeremy backed off and shot David a look. He said,“if it’s one or two ships, maybe we can kill them and get out of here before the rest of ‘em get wind of where we are.” He rubbed Arnold’s shirt straight and smiled with one corner. </p>

        <p>“Kill them?” Tara said.</p>

        <p>The hum formed a crescendo and the RV rattled. They stared out the back window, waiting. </p>

        <p>The craft flew over their hiding spot and over the warehouse into the large parking lot on the opposite end of the building. The RV rocked on its axels as the ship crossed over them, and though they could no longer see the craft, the low sound it emitted, was dominating. A pair of bright blue spotlights could be seen probing the area. </p>

        <p>“I’m goin’.”</p>

        <p>“You can’t Jeremy,” Tara said. </p>

        <p>“Let’s wait Jay, there could be more coming in,” David said.</p>

        <p>“I don’t think so, they’d be here by now.”</p>

        <p>“How do you know that?” </p>

        <p>Tara picked up the large revolver off of the ground and looked out the window. </p>

        <p>“What are you doing?” David said.</p>

        <p>“If there’s more coming, than there is little we can do anyway. If we go in there and catch them off guard, maybe we can...” She cocked the gun.</p>

        <p>Arnold shook his head and mumbled, “this is it, I can feel it.” </p>

        <p>“Okay,” David said ignoring him, “Tara, Jeremy and I will go check out what’s going on.” </p>

        <p>“Why do you need three of you to do that? And why am I stuck in the car?” Arnold said.</p>

        <p>“One of us needs to be ready for a getaway. And if something happens, we have a better chance of someone being around to get back here and tell you about it.”</p>

        <p>“What if they get all three of you?” </p>

        <p>David shrugged. “If we take too long, I give you permission to leave leave.”</p>

        <p>Arnold shook his head mumbling again. </p>

        <p>David and Jeremy grabbed the two shotguns, Jeremy taking the double-barrel and David taking the smaller. Tara carried the magnum. </p>

        <p>“That’s a big gun,” Jeremy said.</p>

        <p>“Shut up.”</p>

        <p>They crept out of the camper and walked around the south side of the building, the deep hum of the craft masking their footsteps. When they reached the corner, Tara checked around it to look for any movement, but there was nothing except more black top. They continued towards the northwest corner, stopping before the parking lot. A blue spotlight glided past them, but they were protected by the corner of the building. David could feel himself start to shiver as it passed by. </p>

        <p>Jeremy put a finger to his lips, waited for the spotlight, and when it was gone he poked his head around the corner. </p>

        <p>“One ship. Looks like...five Icicles on the ground. They are just standing there-oh wait.” </p>

        <p>“BEEP,” cut through air.</p>

        <p>“A sixth guy just dropped out of the ship. He looks mean for a big block of ice.” </p>

        <p>“What do you mean?”</p>

        <p>“He’s...spikier. Looks like the ship is landing too.”</p>

        <p>David could not resist any longer; he stepped out from behind the building and looked. </p>

        <p>The craft was a perfect diamond made of slick blue faces like panes of glass; he’d seen these before. The ground below was freezing as the craft landed. The ice men stood in one line in front of the ship, facing their captain. He-David assumed it was a he-was a head taller than the rest, with long icicles jutting out of his body, and as he paced, his cape of flowing crystal dripped dark blue water, spreading the ice the ship created. </p>

        <p>David could hear him speaking, and felt the hair on the back of his neck stand up. He couldn’t understand the words, but the ice men were moving around the building to the other side towards the camper.</p>

        <p>David and Jeremy pulled back and Jeremy immediately turned and ran back around the building.</p>

        <p>“Jeremy,” David said.</p>

        <p>“I have to tell Arnold!” </p>

        <p>David and Tara chased after him. They could see their breath as they ran, and Tara slipped on the ice, letting out a short shriek as she fell. David helped he up and pulled her along, dragging her around the final corner of the building. </p>

        <p>They saw Jeremy disappear into the camper. The Ice men appeared around the opposite side and David grabbed Tara, pushing her against the wall. </p>

        <p>The Ice captain was approaching the Camper fast. Each of his steps spread a puddle of icy slush beneath him. </p>

        <p>Twenty feet.</p>

        <p>Fifteen feet.</p>

        <p>Ten feet. The captain examined the RV up and down and looked at his soldiers. He uttered a command, his voice like a shifting glacier.</p>

        <p>At that moment, the RV started. </p>

        <p>The sound of the RV startled the Ice men but the captain was not surprised and he spat another command at his squad. The freezing weapons of the ice foot soldier were Long blue cylinders with three spinning discs on the end and the soldiers aimed these weapons at the vehicle but it was already backing out of the ramp. </p>

        <p>The soldiers watched the RV drive away as Jeremy backed the vehicle as far as he could against the opposite wall, leaving half a football field between the soldiers and the car. The RV grumbled as Jeremy revved the engine. A warning. The soldiers looked at their leader and the captain gave an irritated growl. The soldiers sprayed the ground with their weapons, building blue layers of Ice on the black top. </p>

        <p>Jeremy saw this and slammed on the accelerator, the tires peeling violently against the blacktop, sending a plume of black smoke. The five soldiers and their captain stood motionless for the impact, but the car slid as the wheels grabbed at the ice, failing to gain traction, sending it twisting sideways. </p>

        <p>David watched with clenched fists as the RV turned completely horizontal when it got close to the ice men. The screaming of the tires against the ice was echoing against the car lot. Each sliding meter David expected the line of ice men to move out of the vehicle’s way, but still the ice men stood their ground. </p>

        <p>When the RV collided with the Ice men, the crunch of bent metal against shattering ice cut through the air like a sonic boom; fragments of clear blue flew and the RV continued its skid sideways, crashing into the building for second tremendous crunch. </p>

        <p>Tara grabbed David’s arm and David held his breath. He couldn’t see what had happened to the ice men, but he couldn’t control himself and ran over to the Camper. Halfway there, he stopped. </p>

        <p>On the ground, now legless and twitching, with all the helplessness of a wounded hyena, was the ice men’s captain. He started to crawl towards David, leaving a trail of dark blue slush. It regarded him with empty eyes. </p>

        <p>David scanned the area, suddenly afraid of any remaining ice soldier, but there were none to be seen. All that remained were the melting shards, scattered across the asphalt. David walked up to the captain. </p>

        <p>“David come on!” Tara said as she ran by, but David thought that this was his only chance to see this creature up close. Never had he been able to approach one of these monsters without fear of imminent death. </p>

        <p>Looking at the ice man, David decided that this creature was a living crystal. Its skin wasn’t skin but transparent glass or maybe even just clean ice; its beating heart was dark blue and clear on the outside so that David could see the thick dark blood flowing through the connected tubes all blue within blue; all its organs were visible but foreign, and the solid eyes glowed like shining gemstones. The head rotated towards him in a perfect arc. </p>

        <p>“Embrace,” David shuttered at the sound of its voice, but he couldn’t make out the words. </p>

        <p>He stepped closer.</p>

        <p>“Embrace,” it said. “No...pain.” The creature edged a little closer.</p>

        <p>Then creature’s arm slashed forward and its clawed hand grabbed David’s leg. </p>

        <p>David felt like he had been dropped into a frozen lake. He shuddered violently, looking down at his leg which no longer felt like his own. </p>

        <p>He heard its voice from inside his head. </p>

        <p><i>Everything will be over soon. Do not be afraid.</i> </p>

        <p>The voice pulsed through him in waves making him shudder more. He shook his leg to get the arm off but he could see that his leg was doing nothing. </p>

        <p><i>We will take you to a warm place, a place where you will not be alone. Do not be afraid. This planet is ours. Your species will assimilate.</i></p>

        <p><i>Do not be afraid David. You will soon be part of a whole. You will have purpose. </i></p>

        <p>David was warm and so tired. He wanted sleep. </p>

        <p><i>You will be home David, do not be afraid. </i></p>

        <p>He shuddered again and opened his eyes, meeting the creatures gaze. He tried to shake the creature again but knew nothing was happening. </p>

        <p><i>You can go home.</i></p>

        <p>His eyelids slipped down again and the sounds around him faded. He stopped shuddering too. The creatures eyes were still there, but then there was only one eye. It wasn’t an eye though when David looked closely. It was a fire. He was sitting around this fire, the flames licking the air close to his hands, warming his body while the breeze chilled his back. Across the pit, Sara sat warming her hands too, smiling at the fire, enjoying it just as David was. </p>

        <p>A machine marches along a black hallway towards a large round door.</p>

        <p>Sara and David’s eyes met for just a moment to exchange glances of affection. Next to her were David’s parents, their hands extended towards the flames as well. The heat pulsed through David’s hands and through his arms and filled his chest from the inside out. </p>

        <p>An icy soldier touches a console on the machine, and the machine blurts out a series of beeping noises, releasing blue exhaust through its vents.</p>

        <p>All four of them looked up at each other and smiled, not having to say a word about how good this moment felt. The warmth of the fire felt like the greatest gift. David could think of nothing better but sitting there forever with his hands outstretched. He was warm again. </p>

        <p>David first heard the blast inside his mind, then his eyes shot open and he saw the Ice captains body had its head removed. </p>

        <p>His whole body shuddered harder then ever and he gasped at the shocking cold which clutched his insides. </p>

        <p>Jeremy grabbed him by the shoulder, but David couldn’t feel his hand. </p>

        <p>“Come the fuck on!” Jeremy shouted. </p>

        <p>David could not respond, he felt miles away. </p>

        <p>“Godammit,” Jeremy braced David against his shoulder and carried him into the RV. Inside the car Jeremy threw him onto the bed in the back. </p>

        <p>“Something’s wrong with him,” he said. “We are getting out of here,” </p>

        <p>David looked up at Tara, shivering too hard to get a word out. He had to tell her what was out there. </p>

        <p>He knew the machine was out there. David saw his sister’s face in front of the fire, and his parents, but he knew that the only thing that was real was the machine. The giant machine that tore away whole buildings. </p>

        <p>“mm-mmm-mm-mash.” </p>

        <p>Tara rubbed his arms trying to slow down the shivering. She bent down to him. </p>

        <p>“David, speak slowly.” </p>

        <p>“Ma-ma-machh-chi-sheen!”</p>

        <p>Tara shook her head.</p>

        <p>“Ma...Ma,” he shuddered again unable to finish. </p>

        <p>Tara bounded to front of the car.</p>

        <p>“What happened to him?” </p>

        <p>“That thing touched him.” Jeremy said.</p>

        <p>The car whined and squealed as Jeremy backed the camper from the wall he had collided with. Driving slow, he rounded the corners of the building, approaching the parking lot where the Diamond had landed. The hum of craft was omnipresent. The path to the exits took them past the resting alien vehicle across the sea of ice. Jeremy inched along, knocking shopping carts out the way, sending them sliding across the ice.</p>

        <p>“Be slow Jay,” Arnold said.</p>

        <p>Jeremy coaxed the car, trying to keep the heavy vehicle from sliding out of control. It had started to whine from the right front wheel well and the sound was filling the cabin like a crying child. </p>

        <p>“I’m going the far way, I don’t wanna get too close,” Jeremy said.</p>

        <p>No one argued. </p>

        <p>Arnold and Tara stared, hypnotized while David shuddered alone in the back. As they passed the craft, its sheen reflected the camper and its inhabitants. </p>

        <p>They all jumped as the radio spat a new message at them. </p>

        <p>“This...is...the...North American...resistance...” The accent was English. David could hear the radio through his haze.</p>

        <p>“If...you...can hear this, than you have avoided capture. I’m sure you have many questions, and I assure you friend, they will be answered. But let me start with the following: most of our forces have been taken by the invaders, and many of our planes are now frozen in Los Angeles.” </p>

        <p>David could only watch Tara while she listened to the message. He noticed something catch her eye, so he followed her gaze out to the ship. She looked at the diamond ship’s gleaming facade and then covered her mouth. The craft door was opening. </p>

        <p>“Several of us have escaped the area and are now in Oakland with the remaining aircraft. We will wait only so long, the freezers will surely find us again, and we do not intend to be caught.”</p>

        <p>A ball of tangled steel thumped to the ground from the diamond ship; a mix of hard angles and jutting shining metal which sat still on the ice. David and Tara watched the giant ball, Tara whimpering almost silently, and David unable to react at all. A thin blue light came from the ship and crossed the steel ball. In the distant part of him that was still seeing, David felt the twisting sensation of terror inside his gut as the metal ball began to move, unwinding itself into a more recognizable figure. Bending and twisting the metal ball rearranged itself, its arms rotating and shifting to make room for its sharp pelvis, the metal pelvis bulging out then settling itself inside the torso as the mess of metal below formed two trunks for legs, all of its parts glaring against the ice. A metal creature ten feet tall, with large protruding spouts over its shoulders and wide blue pincers for hands stood straight up inside the parking lot; it’s bright blue eyes centered on Tara inside the Camper. </p>

        <p>“If you are hearing this, you must come quickly! Remember, Oakland. We will find you if you make it. We leave tomorrow. Good luck!”</p>

        <p>The machine broke into a run.</p>

        <p>Tara screamed. </p>

        <p>The machine’s steps shook the earth, alerting everyone of the camper of its presence. </p>

        <p>“Go!” Arnold voice cracked at the same time Jeremy smashed his foot on the accelerator, but the car skid in place and the giant machine closed the distance between them by half, spewing steam and water from the spouts on its back and screeching like an furious steam engine. </p>

        <p>The tires spun on the ice, keeping the RV helplessly in place directly in the path of the machine barreling towards it. The large pincers raised as it reached them. </p>
        <br><br>

        </div>
        <h2  class="partLabel">Part 3</h2>
        <div  class="part">
          <p>David heard Jeremy say, “Grab somethi-” and the machine hit the RV like a freight train, sending the camper heaving onto its side towards the asphalt; but the machine grabbed the vehicle with its pincers, bringing it back upright. Arnold flew into the blinds next to David and slumped onto ground, but picked his head up an instant later. A pincer was piercing through the wall but David was too weak to run, still paralyzed with shivers. Arnold looked at the pincer coming towards him and crawled towards the front of the car, the pincer clasping right behind him, missing him by inches. The arm then retracted out of the hole it had created, but in retaliation for its failure gripped the back end of the camper. It let out a squeal as it strained, the camper steel frame fighting back; and the machine let out a second squeal in response, more steam gushing out of its spouts before the giant metal beast ripped the back end of the camper off, leaving David exposed. David was now face to face with the machine. </p>

          <p>The creature’s pure blue eyes peered at David. Two perfect orbs which conveyed nothing but utility. The two orbs moved closer with the machine which now stretched itself deeper inside the camper. As David watched the eyes close in on him, he could hear the string of beeps inside the machine’s head; he could see the dots of condensation running along the metal bars that formed the things face. Lights illuminated and went dark and then flashed, flickered in front of David’s face. </p>

          <p>David pulled a pistol out from beside the bed and stuck it inside the creatures head cavity. He didn’t hesitate to pull the trigger. The bullet ricocheted inside the machines head, the sounds of clanging metal filling the camper, and the giant monster recoiled letting out an ear-piercing screech. David did not have time to enjoy this success, because the creatures head was back in front of him almost as soon as it had exited the car. It opened its jagged mouth and let out its freezing breath. David felt the cold surround him again. His vision became a tunnel of blue. </p>

          <p>Two blasts echoed across the parking lot and the beast pulled out of the camper again, hissing at them. David found himself standing, looking down at Jeremy and Arnold as the circled the metal beast. </p>

          <p>Tara ran over to him and said something he couldn’t hear, so he waved her away and ran to the cabinet where the weapons were held. </p>

          <p>Another two blasts behind him, followed by another screech. </p>

          <p>In the cabinet was the grenade, David grabbed it and hobbled over to the exposed end of the Camper. </p>

          <p>“David, don’t!” This time he heard Tara’s words. </p>

          <p>“Hellllp...th-th-th-them,” David said, and Tara nodded, running outside with the big revolver.</p>

          <p>Arnold came close to the machine when it faced Jeremy and he fired a shot into the beast’s belly; the creature purged a splash of dark blue fluid from the spot, staggering for a spit second. It was only a second though, and with a flash its pincer hand whipped around before Arnold could get out of the way, and the machine lifted him in the air. The gun fell to the ground.</p>

          <p>Arnold screamed as the hand closed on his midsection. David heard the crunch of Arnold’s body fighting the metal grip and losing. </p>

          <p>The blue breath of the machine silenced his scream, turning him into a block of ice within seconds. The machine let go of him and his frozen body hit the ground with a thud.</p>

          <p>Jeremy shouted at the machine and fired more rounds into its chest; and Tara fired the revolver too, causing the thing to leak more and more precious blue fluid. David aimed his pistol at the machine and fired, but the shot went wild and stuck the ice beyond the metallic creature. He was useless. </p>

          <p>David looked at the grenade and pulled out the pin.</p>

          <p>The creature squealed again and charged Jeremy while Tara fired another thundering round. More fluid fell the the ground. </p>

          <p>“Get out of there! G-g-g-grenade!” David yelled as loud as his lungs could allow, but this was not that loud. All that came was a shrill gasp with few words involved. </p>

          <p>David saw the looks from both of his friends as he threw the small bomb. He knew immediately that he had thrown it too far to his right and his insides wrenched so much that he crumpled to the floor before the explosion occurred. </p>

          <p>When Jeremy looked at David, the creature sprayed him with its blue mist, and David watched Jeremy’s last look of shock freeze into finality. The grenade finished the job. </p>

          <p>***</p>

          <p>It was his turn to help Tara.</p>

          <p>He half dragged half carried her towards the empty diamond ship with the 0.38 in his free right hand. The door to the ship was still open though none of the ice men inside had come out to inspect the dead machine, which David took as a good sign. </p>

          <p>He looked back at the mess of machine parts and saw bits of his two friends scattered across the icy parking lot. </p>

          <p>Tara moaned and David bent down to her and whispered in her ear, “Shhh.” </p>

          <p>At the door, he peaked inside the diamond and found the ship empty. The long black shiny halls had white and blue lights cascading up and down which gave them shape and outline. He moved inside and walked down the hall, squinting and holding the pistol in front of him. The ship was freezing, and soon he heard the clattering of Tara’s teeth as she started to shiver. David noticed he was shivering too.</p>

          <p><i>What did you expect?</i> </p>

          <p>Then he heard foot steps echoing down the hall. He slid into a small crevice in the side of the hallway with Tara and waited as the clicking got louder.</p>

          <p>“Shhh,” he said as Tara moaned again. </p>

          <p>The steps came louder and then the ice man was passing in front of the hiding spot David had made. Instead of staying hidden like he had planned, David jumped on the icy creature, dropping Tara to the ground as he did so. The ice man uttered a gurgling sound in surprise and fell to the floor; the shining eyes slanted upward in the middle and the mouth of the creature was open. David looked down at the helpless icy being and felt a savage energy rush through him as he shoved the gun into the creatures mouth and fired twice. The two blasts echoed across the entirety of the ship. </p>

          <p>He picked up Tara and moved farther down the hall, looking back for moment to look at the ice man he had shot. The thing was still and melting.</p>

          <p>The walkway ended in a round door made in the same shining black material of the rest of the craft. Pinpoint thin, curved lines of fluorescent light traveled across the surface of the door, creating round and parallel patterns. David leaned forward and touched the door with the knuckle of his right hand, but he recoiled and cursed as he felt burning cold. He scowled at the door like it had attacked him. When he pulled up his pistol to fire at the inanimate enemy, it hissed and lifted, then whipped into the adjacent wall revealing an ice man standing in the new space. </p>

          <p>David fired more pistol rounds into the ice man’s head and the creatures face splintered and split. After David kicked the slumped body out of the way he dragged Tara into the control center of the diamond. </p>

          <p>The cockpit of the ship was a low ceilinged, small room with a long flat console in front of a massive window which revealed the parking lot. Set in front of the console was a seat made of black ice which protruded upward in two black spikes with its back facing David. Below the window, many screens appeared side by side showing different scenes. One scene showed two machines ripping open a building to reveal a group of people, who were promptly sprayed and frozen. Another showed a city street filled with Ice soldiers, marching down in strict lines aside their spiky officers. On the right side of the window, a screen showed another icy captain in a black chamber, speaking at the screen and waving his hands in awkward jerking motions. </p>

          <p>A scratching sound came from the chair in front of David.</p>

          <p>David pointed the gun at the head and fired but was met with a click instead of a gunshot. This was enough to let the ice man know he was there, and the creature stood up and turned towards David. </p>

          <p>“David,” Tara said and he backed up and laid her down on the ground. She moaned again. </p>

          <p>The ice man uttered a sound which cooled David’s anger. It was high pitched and soft. </p>

          <p>David waited, unsure if he should attack the smaller thing. </p>

          <p>Then the creature raised its hands in front of itself, mist leaking from its face. </p>

          <p>David could see the corpse of the metal beast in the street through the window and for a moment he saw the grenade explosion again. Tara thrown against the RV, Jeremy’s partially frozen body splitting hard in the middle. </p>

          <p>Jeremy’s scream.</p>

          <p>David charged the creature and tried to smash the pistol into its head, but the creature deflected his hand. When the creature touched him, he felt a freakish chill pass through him and he shuddered out of the creatures range. Again the creature made the screeching sound and David ran and dove at it. The creature fell to the ground with David on top; David drove the pistol into the creatures face. The creature screeched and the sound vibrated in David’s head, making him pound harder. Every time the creature touched him the chill grabbed hold, but he was numb to it now, and he pounded the creatures face until he was smashing water into the black floor. </p>

          <p>“David,” he heard behind him.</p>

          <p>Panting, he walked over to Tara. She was still lying where he dropped her, and when she spoke to him, she didn’t move her head. Her eyes were closed.</p>

          <p>“Don’t worry, we’re gonna get out of here,” He said. </p>

          <p>“David,” she said again. </p>

          <p>David looked at her burns. Most of her right hand was missing, and the arm was very black, with pockets of bright red underneath, while her face had a red black look to it with white seeping through the dry cracks. </p>

          <p>“David.”</p>

          <p>He turned away and walked back towards the controls.</p>

          <p>The console seemed to be made of a perfectly clear ice, which appeared identical to glass but was freezing to the touch. It even melted and refroze each time David rubbed his fingertip on the surface. The console displayed a map of the surrounding area; and besides that was a map of a greater surrounding area of the surrounding area; and besides that was an even bigger map showing most of North America. David recognized the California bay area, tapped Oakland on the screen and a red square popped up with a flash. David pressed the red box and held it there until it beeped at him, and without hesitation the craft responded. The ship floated to the air almost knocking him off his feet, and on the map the diamond icon rushed towards the dot he had touched. It didn’t seem far according to the map. </p>

          <p>“David,” Tara said from behind him and he turned his head to look at her. She was opening her eyes now. David picked her up off the ground and gently placed her on the only chair in the room. She laid back against it and her eyes flickered before they opened again, fixing on David. </p>

          <p>“David,” she said and smiled. </p>

          <p>He bent down to meet her, his guts wrenching and spinning and his mind screaming in one wordless tone. She spoke so softly now. </p>

          <p>“Hey Tara, I’m here.” He forced his face to smile, “we’re going, we’re going to Oakland to meet the others.”</p>

          <p>“We made it,” he added.</p>

          <p>She breathed slow and heavy.</p>

          <p>“Where’s Arnold?”</p>

          <p>David felt sick.</p>

          <p>“He’s gonna meet us there, he found another way.”</p>

          <p>She chuckled.</p>

          <p>“You’re no good at lying.”</p>

          <p>She reached up and touched Davids face with her burnt arm, afterward her eyelids blinked in heavy strokes. </p>

          <p>“I’m sorry,” David said feeling his eyes water. </p>

          <p>“David,” she said still smiling. </p>

          <p>Just then the console let out a tone which echoed through the small chamber. The window was flashing. </p>

          <p>“Well go on then,” Tara said with her eyes closed. </p>

          <p>David looked at the console and saw that they were quickly approaching Oakland, through the window he could see nothing though. The sky was clouded and heavy with lightning and thunder. They had arrived in minutes, David thought, but before David saw the city he was already feeling a vast emptiness. On the console, where the city of Oakland should have been, was a little icon showing a miniature monolith. </p>

          <p>When the clouds parted he could see for himself. The city below him was the same as Los Angeles, and Denver, and surely Las Vegas now, and New York, and Berlin, and every other city he guessed. A giant plate of ice where millions had once lived and played and loved. That giant black thing twisting above the endless dark cold ice. </p>

          <p>David stared at the monolith in front of the window. Its surface was like that of a giant skyscraper, only clearer, more alive. The thing shook and rattled like it was it was so powerful as to boast its restraint, even as it ended millions of lives with its very presence. Even the clouds and lightning obeyed their towering commander, their alien subjugator; twisting around the giant black beacon like swooning acolytes. </p>

          <p>No resistance.</p>

          <p>David turned to Tara.</p>

          <p>“Tara,” he said but stopped. </p>

          <p>She was slumped in the chair with her eyes half closed and her mouth slightly open. David’s heart jumped, but then he just sighed to himself, the tears all gone, and bent over to kiss her on the forehead. He closed her eyes with his thumb and forefinger.</p>

          <p>David looked out the window at the raging storm and whirling icon in the middle of it all and grabbed the black stick in the middle of the console, feeling his hand fuse to the thing as it burned him. The craft shuddered but obeyed his movements on the stick as the console beeped angrily like a petulant child. David ignored it all and pressed the stick forward, hurling the craft forward while the clouds and storm rushed past him.</p>

          <p>The monolith grew and grew and more of the furious beeps spilled out of the console. </p>

          <p>He rushed the ship onward towards the spinning terror even as the Monolith covered the entire window, creating dark inside the cabin for David. He felt his face burn from the blazing cold the monolith expelled; his whole world was that black apocalypse, and to this he laughed. He laughed even as his lungs turned to ice. </p>

          <p>The diamond seemed to laugh with David.</p>

          <p>He pushed the stick forward, sending the diamond ship into its monstrous father.</p>

          <p>He didn’t feel the crash of the diamond against the towering monolith; and he didn’t hear the clash of ice on ice either. He instead saw a light in the distance which was growing.</p>

          <p>The fire, David thought, and walked across the sand to where the bonfire was set. </p>

          <p>He sat down on a round rock on the edge of the bonfire next to Tara and his Dad. Jeremy sent him a wave from the other side of the fire, then went back to helping Arnold manage a pot of what looked like more bacon and beans. </p>

          <p>“Gotta stir Jay, gotta stir,” Arnold said.</p>

          <p>“I’m stirring man.”</p>

          <p>More beans? David thought.</p>

          <p>Tara touched his arm and he smiled at her, noticing the heat which came off of her hands.</p>

          <p>“‘s good,” she said looking at the bowl of steaming food. </p>

          <p>David’s mother handed him a bowl of beans and also a napkin which he waved off, but she insisted so he took it. She gave a bowl to David’s father, to Sara, to Tara, and then finally sat down with her own bowl once Arnold had served Jeremy and himself. David watched them all eat, enjoying the food with the warmth of a fire. </p>

          <p>David took a bite himself and looked towards his sister. Her golden skin shone against the fire, and when she smiled at him, her smile was brighter than the sun. </p>

          <p>David felt warm.</p>
